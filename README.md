# imagine - Fast LiDaR simulation in 3D environments

Library for fast sensor data simulation in large 3D environments.

## Design Goals

Mainly designed for robotic applications:

- Perform multiple sensor simulations simultaneously and in realtime
- Perform computations at specific computing devices (CPU, GPU..)
    - Hold data at device of computation
    - Minimal graphical overhead (offscreen-rendering)
- Runtime critical operations
- Easy to use
